* This repository contains the code, dataset, documentation, and conference poster related to the academic paper.

**Abstract:** This project focuses on the predictive analysis of Airbnb prices in Mexico City using supervised learning models. An exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Subsequently, linear regression and multiple regression models are applied to predict prices and availability, adjusting the models to improve their performance. Additionally, the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is implemented to compare its effectiveness against the regression models.
